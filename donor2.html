    <u>Donate Plasma for Money - Get Rewarded for Your Time.</u> <br>
    BioLife plasma donors spend up to an hour and a half, as often as twice a week, in our centers to 
    help save someone's life or improve the quality of it. Plasma cannot be produced synthetically.
     It can only be obtained from healthy, eligible adults; therefore we offer <a href="promo.html">compensation
      </a> to our donors for their commitment to the program. 
     <br><br>For specific information on compensation, please
      contact your local center. 
      <br>To get started donating plasma for money, locate a plasma donation 
      center near you to schedule your plasma donation.

      <div id="Demo1" class="w3-container w3-hide">
        <br>
        <p>  At BioLife, we think it’s pretty awesome that you’re choosing to spend your time donating plasma. 
          Since plasma can’t be made in a lab, people with rare and complex chronic diseases rely on donors
           like you to live healthier and more full lives. Knowing you’re making a vital impact in others’ 
           lives is the best feeling in the world. And getting paid for your time is just the cherry on top.</p>

        How do we compensate our donors?</button>
      <div id="Demo2" class="w3-container w3-hide">
        <br>
        <p>  With the BioLife Debit Card. Every dollar you receive from donating plasma will automatically be 
          loaded onto this card. Your BioLife Debit Card is a Mastercard that can be used to make purchases 
          wherever Debit Mastercard is accepted and at over 900,000 ATM locations worldwide.

        Why do I get compensated for donating plasma, but not for donating blood?</button>
      <div id="Demo3" class="w3-container w3-hide">
        <br>
        <p> Donating plasma takes more time than donating blood. You will spend roughly 1-2 hours at our
        center to complete your donation, so we want to thank you for dedicating this amount of time 
        with us. Taking the time to donate plasma is a commitment but a generous one! For that, we want 
        to reward you. <br>
         
        Your donation is vital in the production of life-changing treatments and therapies for people who 
        suffer from rare or complex chronic diseases. Just two donations of plasma could help make a huge
        difference to someone who relies on plasma therapy. <br>

      <div id="Demo4" class="w3-container w3-hide">
        <br>
        <p> When you refer a friend to donate plasma at BioLife, you could double the impact for people who 
          depend on plasma therapies. You could also earn a buddy bonus that gets deposited on your BioLife
           card. The more friends you refer, the more good you can do and the more you could earn.</p>

      <div id="Demo5" class="w3-container w3-hide">
        <br>
        <p>  Your plasma donation is making a huge impact in other people’s lives. To say thank you, we compensate 
          you for your time. By dedicating a small portion of your time each week donating plasma, you can earn 
          enough money to:
          <dl><dt>Take that vacation</dt>
          <dt>Put a dent in those student loans</dt>
          <dt>Get your holiday shopping done early</dt>
          <dt>Be prepared for an unexpected expense</dt>
          <dt>Buy a friend or family member something nice
          <dt>Pay it forward! Donate your earnings to your favorite charity</dt></dl>

            <p> 
          We <a href="promo.html">compensate </a>every donor for the time they dedicate for each donation, since the process 
          required can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.
