      <h3>About Plasma</h3>
      <p><b>Your body contains approximately 12 pints of whole blood.</b>
        <br>
        Plasma is the pale yellow liquid portion of your blood that can be easily replaced by the body. It consists mainly of water and proteins, which help your body control bleeding and infection.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>How Is Plasma Used?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The plasma collected at BioLife Plasma Services is processed into a wide variety of 
        life-saving therapeutics that benefit thousands of people every day. Plasma-based 
        therapeutics are used in the treatment of serious disorders such as hemophilia and
        immune system deficiencies, and to treat victims of shock and burns. It is important 
        to remember that plasma is not a substance that can be produced in a laboratory or some
        other artificial environment. It can only be obtained from healthy adults. Plasma donors
        help save lives.

   Donation Safety</button>
  <div id="Demo1" class="w3-container w3-hide">
  <br>
  <p> <b>Donating plasma is a low risk procedure with minimal or no side effects</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Before a donor is accepted into the BioLife Plasma Services donor program, he or she must pass a medical 
    examination and a survey of their medical history performed by a member of BioLife's professional medical 
    staff. During each subsequent visit, a staff member checks the donor's vital signs and the donor answers 
    questions about their medical history.
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition, the donor's hematocrit (the percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells) and plasma
     protein levels are checked. Each donation procedure uses sterile and disposable collection materials. Once 
     the donation is complete, the disposable equipment is discarded and replaced with new materials for the next 
     donation. These steps help ensure the safety of the donor and protect the recipients of the therapies processed 
     from their plasma.
     <br>
     <br>
    Here at BioLife Plasma Services, we maintain a safe and healthy environment by following strict regulations 
    and practices designed to safeguard our employees, the patients who receive our plasma-derived products and YOU,
     our donor.
     <br>
     <br>
    <b>Working together to keep you safe & healthy</b>
    Because your plasma is processed into life-saving products, it is critical for you to be healthy at the time of
     your donation. BioLife Plasma Services is not a hospital or ambulatory care facility and does not provide medical 
     care, treatment or see patients. This distinction is important to keep in mind while observing the practices and 
     protective measures we have in place throughout the donation process.
     <br>
     <br>
    You play the most important role in maintaining your health. By working together, we will ensure you have a safe
     and pleasant experience.
     <br>
     <br>
    <b>Donate When You Feel Well:</b> Only donate if you feel healthy. You need your plasma to fight off infections.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Scrapes and Scratches:</b> Cover any scrapes or scratches on your exposed skin before donating.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Our Use of Sterilized and Disposable Equipment:</b> Sterilized equipment is used to collect your plasma. Collection
     equipment that is in contact with your blood or plasma is used only one time and is discarded after each use.
     <br>
     <br>
    <b>Non-disposable Equipment:</b> Virus-killing disinfectants are used to clean and decontaminate all non-disposable 
    equipment and surfaces (such as beds).
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Frequent Hand Washing:</b> You can help reduce the spread of germs by washing your hands frequently, especially 
    after using the restroom.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Protective Measures:</b> We apply the principles of Universal Precautions appropriate for our setting. Employees 
    wear protective gear including gloves, face shields and lab coats. Additionally, employees follow set procedures 
    that have been reviewed by a leading infectious disease specialist from the University of Illinois Medical Center.
     These procedures minimize the opportunity for contact with blood or plasma. If employees have contact with blood 
     or plasma, they will change their equipment immediately and wash their hands. Employees also routinely change 
     their gloves, even when they are not contaminated with blood or plasma.
     <br>
     <br>
    <b>Cleaning the Venipuncture Site:</b> We clean the venipuncture site area with an approved iodine scrub. This 
    reduces the risk of introducing bacteria on the skin during the plasmapheresis process.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Caring for the Venipuncture Site:</b> You should keep the site clean and covered after your donation. This reduces 
    the possibility of any infection in the area. It’s important to keep the finger prick site clean as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    Keep the pressure bandage on for at least 2 hours after your donation.
    <br>
    Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous arm activity the remainder of the day.
    <br>
    If you notice bruising or pain at the site, contact us right away and apply a cold compress. Try to keep the 
    arm above heart level.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you have additional questions, please ask to speak with a member of BioLife Management. BioLife’s Medical
     Director and Environmental, Health and Safety Manager continuously review our policies and practices to ensure 
     that we are adhering to the regulatory requirements established by state and federal agencies, who inspect our
      locations, ensuring that our practices meet or exceed the expectations with regard to eliminating any risk to
       our donors. </p>
