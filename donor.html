                <br>
                You must be in good health and feel well the day you plan to donate.
                <br>

                <u>Identification:</u>

                   IF the identifying document provides all four of the above items: examples include a social 
                   security card, driver's license, valid passport, certified birth certificate, ID card issued
                    by the government agency or other entity (e.g., US military, school, employment, state, etc.), 
                    or permanent residence card issued by CIS. Please note that EXPIRED or illegible forms of 
                    identification are not acceptable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                If you do not have one identifying document that contains the four required items, please bring 
                two or more documents with you to the BioLife center. For specific questions, please visit our 
                Plasma Centers page to locate and contact a plasma donation center near you
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>Diet/Nutrition:</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                Proper food and adequate fluid intake are essential to a successful plasma donation. For additional
                 information in regard to diet and nutrition, please see our BioLife Health and Nutrition Tips or 
                 download BioLife's Health & Nutrition Brochure (PDF).
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <u>Proof of Address:</u>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Do you need proof of address to donate plasma?</b> This area varies by location so if you live 
                more than 40 miles from the BioLife location, contact the plasma center before your first
                appointment to confirm eligibility based on your current address. Any of the documents described 
                in the Identification section may serve as proof of your current address. In addition, a signed 
                lease agreement between you and your current landlord, a utility bill, or other item mailed
                through the United States Postal Service (USPS) and postmarked within the last two months.
                Electronic proof of address, such as the image of a utility bill, following the same guidelines
                as above is acceptable. Some exceptions may apply to the donor recruitment area for college 
                students and military personnel.</p>

          <button onclick="myFunction('Demo2')" class="w3-btn w3-block w3-teal w3-left-align">
            Medical Screening</button>
        <div id="Demo2" class="w3-container w3-hide">
          <br>
          <p> PLEASE NOTE: Your eligibility will be determined at your physical screening or at your next visit 
            to BioLife Plasma Services. We may not be able to provide all eligibility requirements by phone.
            <br>
            <br>
            To assess your health prior to the first plasma donation and at least annually thereafter, our medical
             staff will conduct a medical history interview, a physical examination and a blood test.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The medical history interview consists of a series of questions about your past and present health
             history, including questions regarding possible exposure to certain infectious diseases such as HIV 
             and hepatitis.
             <br>
             <br>
            In addition, prior to each plasma donation, you will perform a self-administered electronic 
            questionnaire using a touch screen system. Upon completing the electronic questionnaire, you will 
            undergo a brief eligibility screening, which includes the determination of your weight, blood pressure, 
            pulse and temperature. This screening also includes a test for anemia (hematocrit) and protein level,
            which requires just a few drops of blood from your finger.
            <br>
            <br>
            The items below do not cover all medications or medical conditions and the eligibility rules may have
            changed since this information was last updated. Additionally, some responses are confidential and can
            only take place when the donor is on-site at a BioLife Plasma services plasmapheresis facility.</p>

            Drugs and Medications</button>
        <div id="Demo3" class="w3-container w3-hide">
          <br>
          <p> <u>Alcohol</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Can you drink alcohol before donating plasma?</b> If you drank alcohol on the day you plan 
            to donate (e.g., smell of alcohol on breath or about the person, slurred vocalizations, etc.),
             you will not be allowed to donate plasma on that day. Alcohol consumption can lead to dehydration
              as well as lower blood pressure and also affect how your body replenishes vital nutrients needed
               for healthy plasma.
               <br>
               <br>
               <u>Antibiotics</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are being treated with antibiotics, you may be eligible for plasma donation depending 
            on the reason for receiving this type of treatment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Immunizations / Vaccinations</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            Plasma donor eligibility varies depending upon the type of immunization / vaccination received,
            the reason for the immunization / vaccination and the presence of any
            symptoms prior to the plasma donation.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Birth Control</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Does birth control affect donating plasma?</b> You are eligible to donate plasma if taking birth 
            control medications.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Other Medications</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Can you donate plasma if you are on medication?</b> In most cases, taking medications does not
             disqualify you from donating plasma. Your acceptance into the plasmapheresis program mostly 
             depends on the type and severity of the medical condition(s) for which you are being treated. 
             Therefore, if you are accepted into our plasmapheresis program, you should continue taking your 
             medication(s) as prescribed by your doctor, even on the day of donation. If a change in your 
             medical condition requires a new treatment or a higher dose of your current treatment, you need 
             to inform our center staff so they may evaluate your continued participation in the program, if needed.
             <br>
             <br>
            In a few instances, you will not be eligible for plasma donation if the medication you are taking
             may harm the patients receiving medications made from this plasma.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            You may be eligible for plasma donation. However, if on the day of donation you have a 
            severe case of acne (extensive inflammation and pus-filled skin lesions), our plasma center
             medical staff may temporarily defer you from plasma donation until your condition has improved
              and meets our plasma donation requirements.

            <br>
            <b>Can you donate plasma with allergies?</b>
            <br>
            If you do not feel well or have any general allergy or cold-like symptoms (e.g., congestion, 
            nasal drainage, hoarse voice, sore throat, headache, watery eyes) on the day of the scheduled
             donation, you should wait until the condition has improved/subsided to donate plasma. Please
              reschedule your appointment and get some rest. You may return to the center for evaluation when 
              you feel well and healthy and no longer show signs of allergy or illness. If you have allergies
               to specific substances, you may be eligible for donation depending upon the type and severity of
                prior reactions and whether the allergen is not used in the facility.

            treatment required for proper control of symptoms. In addition, you must also be free of symptoms
             on the day of donation if accepted into the program.
